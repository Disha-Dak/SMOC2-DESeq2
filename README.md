## SMOC2 in Kidney Fibrosis - DESeq2 Analysis

Overview

Secreted modular calcium-binding protein 2 (SMOC2) belongs to the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) family of matricellular proteins, known to modulate cell-matrix interactions.

In this study scientist conclude that SMOC2 is upregulated in the kidney tubular epithelial cells of mice and humans following fibrosis. Using genetically manipulated mice with SMOC2 overexpression or knockdown, they demonstrate that SMOC2 plays a critical role in kidney fibrosis progression.

## Mechanistic Findings

# SMOC2 activates fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT), leading to:
Stress fiber formation
Increased proliferation and migration
Extracellular matrix (ECM) production
siRNA-mediated targeting of SMOC2 results in:
Attenuation of TGFÎ²1-mediated FMT in vitro
Amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice
These findings highlight SMOC2 as a key signaling molecule in the pathological secretome of a damaged kidney and suggest that targeting SMOC2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for kidney fibrosis.
